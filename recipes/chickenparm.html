    <img src="skinny-chicken-parmigiana-550x733.webp" alt="chickenparm on a plate">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan started way back with Eggplant Parmigiana in Campania and Sicily in Italy. <br>
        You deep fry eggplant and then add cheese and tomato sauce. Then bake it, and enjoy. At some <br>
        points, cooks in North America, and other regions of the world with large Italian immigrant <br>
        populations, realized that chicken would be an excellent alternative to the eggplant and Chicken <br>
        Parmigiana was born.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large pank bread crumbs, or more as needed.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons, all-purpose flour, or more if needed.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying,or as needed.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) <br>
            on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a <br>
            thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, <br>
            pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook <br>
            chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking <br>
            in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each <br>
            chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle <br>
            remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink <br>
            in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at <br>
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
